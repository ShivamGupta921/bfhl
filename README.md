## Backend

### Problem Statement
Build and deploy a REST API with one endpoint that accepts requests with both GET and POST methods.
POST method endpoint takes in the request (JSON) and returns the following:
1. Status
2. User ID
3. College Email ID
4. College Roll Number
5. Array for numbers
6. Array for alphabets
GET method endpoint doesn’t take any user input, it just returns an operation_code





## Frontend

### Problem Statement
Develop and deploy a frontend application that uses the backend you’ve developed to process the input and
get response, then render it on frontend. (Preferably React based – including frameworks like Next.js, but
that’s optional).



### Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter a valid JSON in the input field and submit it.
3. View the processed data and select options from the dropdown.
